#### BILL ON SECOND READING
S. No. 1558—Safe Streets, Workplaces and Public Spaces Act of 2017
{Continuation)
**Senator Zubiri.** Mr. President, I move that we resume consideration of
Senate Bill No. 1558 as reported out under Committee Report No. 156.
**The President Pro Tempore.** Is there any objection? [Silence] There
being none, resumption of consideration of Senate Bill No. 1558 is now in
order.
**Senator Zubiri.** Mr. President, the parliamentary status of the measure
is that we are still in the period of interpellations. I ask that we recognize the
sponsor. Sen. Risa Hontiveros; and to interpellate, the distinguished Senate
President.
SUSPENSION OF SESSION
Mr. President, may I ask for a one-minute suspension of the session.
**The President Pro Tempore.** Is there any objection? [Silence] There
being none, the session is suspended for one minute.
It was 4:08p.m.
RESUMPTION OF SESSION
At 4:09p.m., the session was resumed.
**The President Pro Tempore.** The session is resumed.
Senator Sotto is recognized.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you, Mr. President.
Will the distinguished sponsor favor us with answers to our part two of
our interpellations on Senate Bill No. 1558?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Very gladly, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you, Mr. President.
 Again, at the outset, I would like to, place on record the fact that I
support the measure except for a few points that 1 would like to be enlightened
on or perhaps an amendment accommodated ai lhe proper time. So, may I call
the attention of the sponsor to page 2, line 2 and und out why the phrase “with
no intent to harass” added? Because this being aN^pecial law, “intent” is never
an element in the commission of the prohibited act. So, why do we need to
include this phrase “with no intent to harass?”
**Senator Hontiveros.** Mr. President, saying first that in certain prohibited
acts that are identified by this bill, “intent” may play a role. The intent of the
phrase on page 2, line 2 pointed out by the good Senate President is to indicate
that there may be certain expressions of indigenous culture or tradition
pertaining to indigenous peoples in the Philippines which, if taken out of their
indigenous context, may be interpreted by mainstream lowland Filipinos such
as us as falling under the prohibited acts identified by this bill. And this phrase
would probably be even better, more concretely and specifically defined or
delineated in the implementing rules and regulations of this bill if and when it
is passed into law.
**Senator Sotto.** It is like that the act is wrong so we need not look into
the intent. And this is a special law. I am sure the lawyers in the hall
understand what I mean that intent is never an issue in a special law.
**Senator Hontiveros.** I would just want to add, Mr. President, if all of us
were already as enlightened as the good Senate President, that we would
interpret and engage all expressions of indigenous culture and tradition as not
akin to any of the prohibited acts which may be identified by this bill then,
perhaps, there would be no need to include such a phrase as “with no intent to
harass.” But aware that in current Philippine society where we are still working
towards more complete inclusiveness and diversity between and among
mainstream lowland people such as us, the majority of Filipinos, vis-a-vis
indigenous peoples, then that is the reason that this phrase was included.
But, again, as mentioned also by the good Senate President in his
introductory remarks to this part two of the interpellations, at the proper time,
I would consider a proposed amendment that still upholds legitimate
expressions of indigenous culture and tradition at the same time addressing
the concern that the good Senate President is raising.
**Senator Sotto.** Yes, Mr. President. Perhaps, the sponsor may be able to
spread also into the Record so that it would enlighten the scholars of the future
who will look into this Journal and see who do we mean by this “indigenous
culture and tradition.” Who are they?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Indigenous peoples, Mr. President, would be those
ethnolinguistic communities identified by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples to include, for example, the indigenous peoples of the
Cordilleras, indigenous peoples among many of our lowland provinces and, of
course, also indigenous peoples of the current Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao on which the Congress of the Philippines has recently passed
historic law or the Bangsamoro Organic Law. And in more popular language,
the indigenous peoples of the Philippines could be described as those living and
practicing non-mainstream cultures.
**Senator Sotto.** Mr. President, we would ask that the sponsor give us a
copy of those covered under indigenous culture and tradition.
**Senator Hontiveros.** I will gladly do so, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you.
**Senator Hontiveros.** And, as I mentioned earlier, in the future IRRs,
perhaps, Mr. President, we could even include specific indigenous practices
referred to by this phrase in the IRR.
**Senator Sotto.** All right. Let me move forward then. I will await the
submission.
On page 2, Section 4, subparagraph 1, on the Gender Sensitivity
Seminar provision, it mentions that it will be conducted by the Philippine
Commission on Women (PCW). Now, just to be clear, will the program of the
PCW cover women offenders against a male victim? Because I have the
impression that a seminar conducted by PCW will cater only to educate male
offenders against women victims. So, can the sponsor provide us a copy of the
proposed scope of the Gender Sensitivity Seminar?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President, we will be glad to do so, and
there the good Senate President will see that the participants in these
contemplated Gender Sensitivity Seminars will certainly include women who
may be identified as offenders under this law, in a minority number of cases of
sexual harassment in the streets or in public spaces.
**Senator Sotto.** All right. Thank you.
On page 3, lines 19 to 21, it says that nothing in this law shall prevent
LGUs from imposing heavier penalties. The question is, is this not violative of
the constitutional principle that local government units are able to legislate
only by virtue of the delegation of legislative power from the national
legislature, that the delegate cannot be superior to the principal or exercise
powers higher than those of the latter? There is a jurisprudence to this. This
is the Supreme Court ruling in Magtajas vs. Pryce Properties, Inc., under G.R.
38 No. 111097 dated 20 July 1994, 234 SCRA 255. So, I do not think we can do
this.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Noting first, Mr. President, that in other
jurisdictions in our region, for example, Singapore which already criminalizes
sexual harassment in public spaces where the penalties are heavier.
Nonetheless, at the proper time, we would accommodate a proposed
amendment from the good Senate President on this section.
**Senator Sotto.** All right. Thank you.
Now, related to my previous question is Section 9 of this proposed
measure, on the duties of local government units, which states that the LGU is
mandated to “(p)ass an ordinance which shall localize the applicability of this
Act within sixty (60) days of its effectivity.” Now, the question is, is it not this
provision is unnecessary due to the fact that this bill is intended to be of
national application, unlike the local bills that we have been passing￾sponsored by Senator Angara—that have limited applicability, therefore,
passing an ordinance is not necessary?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Mr. President, it may be in certain local
government units where their intent is, maybe, to pass an ordinance identical
to the national law. What the good Senate President has said will be absolutely
true, that it would be superfluous, it would be a mere duplication, but, the
important word in this Section 9(a) is “localize.” So, if there may be particular
conditions obtaining in that local government unit, which its local legislative
council may see fit to include in a local ordinance, then it would not be a mere
superfluity or certainly, it would not be harmful.
**Senator Sotto.** 1 hope it is not thought of that way and this will not
become a precedent because under the same section, we have a subparagraph
which says that the LGUs shall “(d)iscourage and impose fines on acts of
sexual harassment as defined in this Act.” So, is the fine mentioned here on
top of the penalty that we are already imposing in Section 4 of this bill? So, an
ordinance may enact more penalties or more fines?
**Senator Hontiveros.** 1 believe, Mr. President, that to the earlier question
of the Senate President, I indicated that, at the proper time, 1 would
accommodate an amendment on that previous section on page 3, lines 19 to
20 which reads at the present, “Nothing in this law shall prevent LGUs from
coming up with ordinances that impose heavier penalties.” And, therefore, in
the interest of consistency, 1 would also, at the proper time, accommodate an
amendment on this page 5, line 17 regarding imposing fines.
**Senator Sotto.** Yes. And, perhaps, we need not delete the entire line if
we replace the word “shall” with the word MAY.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** Sapagkat kapag sinabi noting “shall”, kailangang gawin
nila, hindi ba?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President. At the proper time, I will
consider that.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you for accepting that at the proper time.
Now, in Section 5 of the bill, on the Authority to Apprehend Gender￾based Street Harassment Perpetrators for Light and Medium Offenses, the
enforcers of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will be deputized
to be anti-sexual harassment enforcers (A-SHE) for Metro Manila. Now, as
such, the MMDA enforcers shall be authorized to receive complaints in the
streets and immediately apprehend the offender if caught in what they call “in
flagrante delicto.” But, Mr. President, based on the charter of MMDA, its
primary mandate is to perform planning, monitoring and coordinative
functions and, in the process, exercise regulatory and supervisory authority
over the delivery of metro-wide services within Metro Manila without
diminution of the autonomy of the local government units concerning purely
local matters.
Now, the said law of the MMDA did not mention maintenance of peace
and order, among others, as functions of MMDA, and I know this for a fact
because I am the principal author and sponsor of the law creating the Metro
Manila Development Authority in the Ninth Congress.
So, considering that, does this bill amend the charter of the MMDA by
giving them additional functions similar to that of the Philippine National
Police?
**Senator Hontiveros.** No, Mr. President. The bill does not attempt to
amend the charter of the Metro Manila Development Authority. And, in fact, it
could be seen as fleshing out one of the mandates mentioned by the good
Senate President just now, that of the regulatory function.
So, the bill seeks that the MMDA would deputize its enforcers to be anti￾sexual harassment enforcers or A-SHEs. And the bill sees that this is
consistent with the given mandate of the MMDA, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** Perhaps, it would be more acceptable if the sponsor said
that the PNP will deputize the MMDA. The MMDA cannot deputize their
enforcers to do that to maintain peace and order, but the PNP may do so. Now,
in the bill of the sponsor, the PNP deputizes. So, perhaps, she can just place
the same proposal instead, removing that and allowing PNP to deputize.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Thank you very much, Mr. President, for that good
advice from the good Senate President. I will get to work on it right away.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you.
Now, does the bill of the sponsor amend or repeal Republic Act No. 7877,
otherwise known as the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995?
**Senator Hontiveros.** No, Mr. President. In fact, this bill seeks to
strengthen further the current Anti-Sexual Harassment Law by complementing
it. I actually have two bills.
**Senator Sotto.** Complementing or amending, forgive me.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Strengthening it, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** Strengthening it.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** And are we amending it?
**Senator Hontiveros.** No, Mr. President. We are strengthening it.
Currently, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law identifies, prohibits and penalizes acts of sexual harassment by superiors to their subordinates. But one of my other bills seeks to introduce the offense of sexual harassment even by a
subordinate to a superior, and this particular bill on Safe Streets and Public Spaces seeks to introduce the offense of sexual harassment between complete strangers and on the streets and other public spaces, thereby filling the current gaps observed in our current Anti-Sexual Harassment Law
.
**Senator Sotto.** I will be happy to look at those gaps because the way I
see it, it appears that many substantial provisions of the Anti-Sexual
Harassment Act have been copied and reworded in this bill. So, it is a repeal, it
is not just an amendment.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Actually, Mr. President, I wasjust following on the
line of questioning of the good Senate President to submit that indeed this bill
seeks to strengthen the current Anti-Sexual Harassment Law by way of
amending it. So, not repealing but by amending it.
**Senator Sotto.** It does not appear that way, but we will accept the
opinion of the distinguished sponsor. **Senator Hontiveros.** Thank you, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** All right. Let me move on so that our colleagues would
be able to see where I am coming from.
In page 4, line 13, what is the rationale of specifying a government
agency that is offering front-line services? Why not include all government
agencies and not just front-line services?
**Senator Hontiveros.** This is to give emphasis, Mr. President, that in the
premises of government agencies where there is direct contact with the citizens,
with government’s constituents, and where the standard for the quality of
service rendered is especially high that, if in this setting, the sexual
harassment occurs, then the penalty next higher in degree will be applied. So,
it is to show that there is an even higher standard because such offense does
not inspire confidence in the civil service and it violates that higher standard of
conduct of those who work in government. Therefore, this is the rationale for
the qualified offenses in Section 6 of this bill.
**Senator Sotto.** Now that the good sponsor mentioned about penalties
as punishable, this is partly why I think we are repealing and not amending.
Under Section 4 of the bill, the acts punishable are enumerated. The acts that
the sponsor enumerated are already punishable under our present Revised
Penal Code. Let me continue. For acts under light violations such as cursing,
cat-calling, said acts are punishable under Article 287, paragraph 2 of the
Revised Penal Code for the crime of unjust vexation. Unjust vexation is any
human conduct which, although, not productive of some physical harm would,
however, unjustly annoy or vex an innocent person.
Now, under the Revised Penal Code, unjust vexation is punishable with
arresto menor or one day to 30 days and a fine not exceeding P40,000. The
penalty provided by the Revised Penal Code is equal in terms of imprisonment
and the fine is higher than in our proposed bill. Parang ibinababa natin.
Also, to continue, under medium violations in this bill, the act of making
offensive body gestures at someone or exposing parts for the sexual
gratification of the perpetrator are already punishable under Article 200 of the
Revised Penal Code for the crime of grave scandal.
Now, under the Revised Penal Code, grave scandal is when a person shall
offend against decency or good customs by any highly scandalous conduct.
These must be committed publicly and have given rise to public scandal to
persons who have witnessed the said indecent act. The penalty is arresto
mayor and public censure which is one month and one day to six months 
imprisonment.
mayroon na.
This imprisonment is equal to the proposed bill but, again,
Also, under the severe violations for acts such as touching or brushing
against the body of a person or brushing against the genitalia are already
punishable under the Revised Penal Code and the Special Penal Law. Now, the
said brushing against the body of a person may be punishable under Article
336 of the Revised Penal Code for acts of lasciviousness punishable by prision
correccional, six months and one day to six years imprisonment and this is
higher than our proposed penalty in the bill which is only arresto mayor.
Also, Mr. President, the act of brushing against a genitalia is punishable
by another article. Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code, for the crime of rape
as sexual assault which is punishable by prision mayor, six years and one day
to 12 years imprisonment. This is higher again than our proposed bill.
So, why are we criminalizing the acts mentioned in the bill? First of all,
why are we lowering the penalties? We will be amending the Revised Penal
Code and we will be lowering the penalties while it is already in the Revised
Penal Code and it imposes a higher penalty. So, why do we want to do this,
Mr. President?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Thank you very much, Mr. President, for noticing
and pointing out what may seem to be a lowering of penalties. 1 would like to
note that the penalties proposed in this bill for light, medium and severe
violations from first, second to third offenses would be a package of penalties to
include community service, gender sensitivity seminars and the like. But if the
good Senate President in the period of amendments would like to propose
raising those penalties that he has mentioned and which are lower in the bill, 1
would be very open to that.
1 appreciate also very much the Senate President mentioning other laws
that would seem to already cover sexual harassment in streets and other
public spaces because that observation will show us where the gaps in the
current laws are which are sought to be filled by the Safe Streets and Public
Spaces bill.
For example, currently, under the Revised Penal Code, acts of
lasciviousness require the touching of genitalia and do not make a distinction
as to whether the crime was committed in a private space or a public space,
which the latter is the point that the Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill wishes
to make that sexual harassment in public spaces punishable.
Also, the Revised Penal Code, yes, provides for penalties for unjust
vexation but as currently defined, unjust vexation does not require a sexual
element and is blind to gender. Whereas, the Safe Street and Public Spaces bill points out that sexual harassment is precisely of a sexual element and is not
blind to gender. And also, the Revised Penal Code identifies rape and sexual
assault acts. But under the RPC, these acts do not include non-physical sexual
assault, for example, verbal sexual assault that also degrades and objectifies
women.
So, the penalties sought under the Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill
seek to provide a package of penalties. But as 1 mentioned earlier, 1 would be
open to accept if the good Senate President would propose higher penalties in
the period of amendments. The bill seeks to propose package of penalties
cognizant, precisely, because sexual harassment in public spaces is a category
of offenses that are not adequately identified and provided for in the penalties
under the existing Revised Penal Code, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** But just one point before 1 go back to pencil pushing and
research because I would like to study the impact of this bill on the Revised
Penal Code even if we raise the penalties. And do not talk to Senator Pacquiao
about raising penalties, he might suggest a firing squad.
**Senator Hontiveros.** There is no death penalty in the bill, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** But just one last point, the sponsor said that the Revised
Penal Code issue on the acts of lasciviousness and the like is blind to gender.
Is it not good that it should be blind to gender?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Unjust vexation is the example I gave, Mr.
President, of an offense that under the current Revised Penal Code is blind to
gender.
**Senator Sotto.** Then that is good.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Actually, Mr. President, the blindness to gender is
seen as a gap in the current Revised Penal Code, a gap that the Safe Street and
Public Spaces bill seeks to fill.
**Senator Sotto.** Can the sponsor educate me on what is the gap? Give me
an example, Mr. President, as if 1 am in Grade 3. 1 do not understand.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President. The Safe Streets and Public
Spaces bill seeks to prohibit certain acts and provide penalties for them for acts
of sexual harassment against individuals because of their actual or perceived
sex or gender to include their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender
expression.
The bill considers the blindness to these aspects of the criminal offenses
as a gap because it leaves victims or survivors of this kind of sexual harassment on streets and in public spaces bereft of remedies when they
cannot argue or prove before a court that, precisely, they were subjected to
these acts of sexual harassment in those public spaces because of their actual
or perceived sex and gender, Mr. President. For example, calling a gay person
names like salot ng lipunan, this is not yet covered. This is not yet perceived by
the eye of our Revised Penal Code as sexual harassment. But the Safe Streets
and Public Spaces Act seeks to provide greater vision in this matter or to relieve
the blindness of the law in this matter.
**Senator Sotto.** Is it not better if it is applicable to all? Therefore, we
should be blind to gender, whether the person is a male, female, gay or
whatever?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Definitely, Mr. President, the bill is for everyone
because everyone has a sex, everyone has a gender, everyone has gender
expression and gender identity.
Just to give additional concrete examples, Mr. President. 1 said in earlier
interpellations that most of the victims of sexual harassment on streets and in
public spaces are women. But there is also a minority number of victims and
survivors of sexual harassment on streets and public spaces who are men.
Some of these may be gay men, some may also be street men. A gay man may
be taunted as a “softy” for appearing soft on the streets. A street man may also
have recourse to the Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill or law if he feels that
he has been sexually harassed by another person because of his actual or
perceived sex and gender as a street man. Definitely, the bill is for everyone
because it seeks to provide every individual of whatever sex or gender relief
from sexual harassment on the streets and in public spaces.
**Senator Sotto.** If it is for everyone, then why are we not allowing it to be
blind to gender?
**Senator Hontiveros.**
Mr. President.
We are not allowing it to remain blind to gender.
**Senator Sotto.** To be applicable to all, it should be blind to gender.
**Senator Hontiveros.** On the other hand, Mr. President, in the same way
that our human rights laws are not blind, for example, to nationality, to class,
to region of the world where these laws may be invoked in order to receive
justice for human rights violations in the same way that our international
humanitarian laws are not blind to whether the persons seeking redress of
grievance under international humanitarian law are claiming violations by
state actors or by non-state actors. In the same way, it is for the good of our
citizens and for a more and more progressive body of laws over time that our
laws become cited and not blind to different aspects of the humanity of its citizens as well as to different aspects of the different characteristics of those
who are accused or suspected as violators.
**Senator Sotto.** Forgive me, Mr. President, it just caught my attention
now that the bill is limiting because in the title itself. An Act Defining and
Penalizing Gender-Based Street and Public Spaces Harassment. Bakit hindi na
lamang, An Act Defining and Penalizing Street and Public Spaces Harassment,
Expanding the Definition of...para iyon nga, blind to gender? Anyway, perhaps
at the proper time, we will propose an amendment. Thank you.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Perhaps, at the proper time, Mr. President.
Additionally, there are certain acts that are specifically done to demean a
person because of his gender and these kinds of acts are not yet captured by
the Revised Penal Code, but may be captured by certain provisions of the Safe
Streets and Public Spaces bill.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you. Mr. President, I wish to thank the
distinguished sponsor. As I said, we will research and look at the impact on
the Revised Penal Code and perhaps, wait for the period of amendments.
The Minority Leader wishes to be recognized, Mr. President.
**The President Pro Tempore.** The Minority Leader is recognized.
**Senator Drilon.** With the permission of the sponsor and the gentleman
on the Floor.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President.
**Senator Drilon.** I was listening to the debate. I was wondering, Mr.
President, are the penalties in the proposed measure in addition to the
penalties under the Revised Penal Code for the same acts committed?
**Senator Hontiveros.** No, Mr. President, they are not in addition.
**Senator Drilon.** They are not in addition.
**Senator Hontiveros.** I am sorry, Mr. President, I stand corrected. I
wish to correct myself on the record. They are in addition to the penalties
prescribed by the Revised Penal Code.
**Senator Drilon.** So that, let us say, unjust vexation as pointed out by
the Senate President, what is the penalty proposed under the bill that is under
sponsorship today, Mr. President?

citizens as well as to different aspects of the different characteristics of those
who are accused or suspected as violators.
**Senator Sotto.** Forgive me, Mr. President, it just caught my attention
now that the bill is limiting because in the title itself. An Act Defining and
Penalizing Gender-Based Street and Public Spaces Harassment. Bakit hindi na

SUSPENSION OF CONSIDERATION OF S. NO. 1558
**Senator Zubiri.** Mr. President, I move that we suspend
consideration of Senate Bill No. 1558.
**The President Pro Tempore.** Is there any objection [Silence] There
being none, the motion is approved.

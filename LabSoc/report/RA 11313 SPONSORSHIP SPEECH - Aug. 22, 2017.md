SPONSORSHIP SPEECH OF SENATOR HONTIVEROS

Senator Hontiveros. “Hi Sexy! ” 'Wow legs! ” “Pahipo namanl ” “Ang
ganda mo, te, L ako sa iyo\” “Hoy, babae ka ba o bakla?” Imagine, Mr.President, walking down the streets and alleys of the city, and being subjected to catcalls of that sort and wolf-whistles from jeering bystanders. Imagine feeling reduced to the sum of your body parts, imagine being judged for the way you dress. And then imagine having to fear this every day of your life, imagine never feeling safe in the public spaces of the city that we call our home.

Mr. President, magandang hapon po.

What I just described are the realities that confront women and LGBT
every day in streets and public spaces. Street harassment and public
spaces harassment remain to be a persistent problem of our time. An
overwhelming 88% of women aged 18 to 24 years old experienced sexual
harassment in the streets (according to SWS in 2016). While wolf-whistling
and catcalling are the more common cases, other forms of sexual
harassment include stalking, rubbing or touching, indecent gestures,
exhibitionism and public masturbation. The majority of these incidents take
place on the streets and small alleys, but they have also been reported to
happen in public vehicles, public washrooms, schools, and workplaces.
Seeking to address this problem, the Committee on Women, Children,
Family Relations and Gender Equality wishes to sponsor on the Floor
Committee Report No. 156, entitled Safe Streets, Public Spaces and
Workplaces Act. This committee report consolidates Senate Bill No. 1326, or
An Act Penalizing Gender-Based Street and Public Spaces Harassment,
Senate Bill No. 1250, or the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 2016, and
Senate Bill No. 1254 filed by Sen. Grace Poe, otherwise known as An Act To
Eliminate All Forms of Sexual Harassment in Work Places, Educational
Institutions, and Public Places.

This substitute bill imposes penalties against unwanted comments,
gestures, and actions forced on a person in a public place without her/his
consent and which are directed at the person because of his/her actual or
perceived sex, gender, gender expression, or sexual orientation and identity.
Specific acts include but are not limited to unwanted cursing, wolf￾whistling, catcalling, leering, sexist, homophobic or transphobic slurs,
persistent request for someone’s name, number or destination after clear
refusal, persistent telling of sexual jokes, use of sexual names, comments
and demands, following, flashing, public masturbation, groping, and
stalking.
Secondly, it also includes specifie provisions for harassment in
schools, harassment in publie utility vehieles, and harassment in privately￾owned spaces that are open to the public such as restaurants and malls.
Moreover, it addresses an important gap in our existing Sexual
Harassment Law by penalizing peer-to-peer sexual harassment. This has
been a long-sought amendment by women’s rights advoeates, in recognition
of the inherent power relations between the male and female genders that
can lead to oppressions and aggressions even between individuals of similar
rank in the workplace.
Finally, the bills provide for awareness-raising programs and
edueational modules in order to propagate awareness of and vigilance
against gender-based street and public spaces harassment.
Mr. President, our women and our brothers and sisters in the LGBT
community have a right to be protected in public spaces. Men and women
should have the same opportunities to thrive within our cities and
communities, and to have an active public life. Men and women have the
right to feel safe in our workplaces. This cannot be possible if we constantly
feel under threat of what lurks in the shadows. Many countries have
already recognized the pernicious problem of street and public spaces
harassment. In fact, in Nicaragua, its street harassment law has generated
so much awareness and consciousness that Nicaraguan women have been
known to ciy out “La ley!” (translated as, the law) right on the street when
confronted with an abuser.
We needed our version of this law yesterday, Mr. President. Let us
make our streets and public spaces safer for women. Let us make our
schools and workplaces free from gender-based harassment and sexual
violence. Let us make public recreation areas truly recreational and
uplifting.
Maraming salamat po.


Senator Villanueva. Mr. President.
The President. Senator Villanueva is recognized.
Senator Villanueva. Mr. President, with the indulgence of our
colleagues and if it is all right with the distinguished sponsor, I would like to
put on record that this representation would like to be a coauthor of this
particular measure. 1 think this is very important. We fought for this
particular measure when we were still in the House of Representatives and I
think it is about time that we passed such measure. I think a lot of LGUs
all over the country have passed ordinances which are similar to this
particular measure. The distinguished sponsor is correct in stating also in
public areas. I have gotten so many complaints, for example, those who are
riding public buses when the driver or the conductor will show pornographic
materials. So, this is something that we should look into and this
representation would like to put on record that I am in full support with the
distinguished sponsor.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Senator Hontiveros. Maraming salamat po, Mr. President, and veiy
gladly accepted. And, I believe I speak for my sister and coauthor, Sen.
Grace Poe.

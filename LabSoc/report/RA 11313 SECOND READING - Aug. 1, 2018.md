RESUMPTION OF SESSION
AT 5:51 p.m., the session was resumed.
The Presiding Officer [Sen. Honasan]. The session is resumed.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you, Mr. President. Will the distinguished
lady from Akbayan favor us with some answers to very few questions?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Very gladly from the good Senate President,
especially because, if I may note, this Safe Streets and Public Places bill is
now a priority legislation in the LEDAC. And most especially because the
Quezon City safe streets ordinance was co-introduced by 31 councilors,
including the good Senate President’s son. Councilor Giancarlo Sotto. So, I
am doubly glad to take questions from my Senate President, especially as
this will surely further improve the bill.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you, Mr. President. I almost ended my
interpellation.
**Senator Hontiveros.** The good Senate President may do so, if he
wishes, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** But prudence dictates that I clarify some of the
points. At the outset, I give my 100% support. My interpellation will, more
or less, give us a better perspective of the intents and the contents of the
bill.
**Senator Hontiveros.** I am very confident of that, Mr. President, and
thank you so much.
**Senator Sotto.** Thank you, Mr. President.
The questions will be few but there will be some predicates that I have
to lay out so that we could get the better perspective of the distinguished
sponsor.
Going to the meat of Senate Bill No. 1558, one of the issues that
caught my attention on the Safe Streets, Workplaces and Public Spaces Act


of 2017, which I am sure we will be amending to 2018 soon, is somewhat
analogous with Senate Bill No. 1271 or the Anti-Discrimination bill also filed
by the sponsor.
Just to lay it out, and for the sponsor to help this representation and
this Chamber to have a better understanding and appreciation of these two
measures, can the sponsor differentiate the two, particularly in terms of
making unlawful act of harassment of person because of his or her sexual
orientation whieh are both present in both bills?
To cite an example so that our colleagues will be able to follow. Senate
Bill No. 1271 mentioned that “inciting violence and sexual abuse against
any person or group on the basis of SOGIE is likewise prohibited.” While in
Senate Bill No. 1558, part of the provisions of Gender-based Street and
Public Spaces Harassment states, “Gender-based street and public spaces
harassment is constitutive of unwanted comments, gestures and actions
forced on a person in a public space without their consent and is directed at
them because of their actual or perceived sex, gender, gender expression, or
sexual orientation and identity.” Hindi ba parang parehong-pareho?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Thank you so much for that question, Mr.
President. There may be some overlaps between the two bills but in large
part, each of them is seeking to provide proteetion from particular actions to
what may also be distinct or discrete constituencies. This Safe Streets and
Public Spaces bill seeks to identify, to penalize and to prevent, through
behavior change, sexual harassment that happens in public spaces,
including on the streets between even complete strangers.
Although, the statistics show that the majority of victims of street
sexual harassment would be women, there are also a smaller number of
LGBT eitizens who are victimized by streets and public spaces harassment.
There is also a smaller percentage of men who are victimized by street-based
sexual harassment.
The subject, on the other hand, of the Anti-Discrimination bill is the
whole community of LGBT Filipinos: lesbians, gays, bisexuals and
transgenders. We may even add intersex, queer, et cetera who have been
victims in the large part—victims of discrimination based on their sexual
orientation and gender identity.
So, although, as the good Senate President pointed out, there may be
some overlaps, in large part. The important distinction to make between
these two bills, Mr. President, is that, this bill, the Safe Streets and Public
Spaces, writes into Public Spaces Harassment Law violations on the basis of
SOGIE. The Anti-Discrimination bill is focusing on discrimination based on
SOGIE. The emphasis in this bill. Safe Streets and Public Spaces is public
spaces. So, there are some overlaps but there are important gaps. And in
those overlaps, if 1 may further point out, there may be double
discrimination that happens or double harassment that happens.

**Senator Sotto.** First of all, 1 agree with the intention of both bills as
far as this is concerned. But my problem is that there might be a confusion
or difficulty in prosecution. Alin ang gagamitin kapag parehong naipasa
iyong bill na iyan. Aling bill iyong itsa-charge siya? lyong sa Anti-Discrimination o rito sa Safe Streets and Public Spaces kung nag-o-over\ap
at pareho?
**Senator Hontiveros.** The two bills, Mr. President, also seek to address different gaps in Philippine law, especially where current laws only
identify one set of violations or prohibited acts and where current laws only
penalize certain types of these prohibited acts and not all the prohibited acts
more comprehensively.

I would like to point out, Mr. President, that discrimination is different
from harassment. In our appreciation of current law, in our intention to improve them through these two different bills, the one we are interpellating now on Safe Streets and Public Spaces and the other one on Anti-Discrimination, we are seeking to improve both. That confidence in
Philippine law continues that there will not be confusion generated or
entertained by our law enforcement authorities or by our judicial authorities when receiving a complaint, say, from a woman under the Safe Streets and Public Spaces Act or from LGBT Filipino under the Anti-Discrimination Act.

The overlap is when an LGBT person is assaulted in public spaces. In that situation, the individual victim may choose one redress mechanism. Like she may also opt to file under unjust vexation or act of lasciviousness if in her and her lawyer’s appreciation either of these two is sufficient. However,
as the Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill is pointing out, there are
important gaps even in these laws on unjust vexation, or acts of
lasciviousness, or other current laws, protecting women which this current
Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill is seeking to address.
**Senator Sotto.** My woriy is that we might be diluting one or both if
we have overlaps on the contents and the... Anyway, the sponsor is saying
that the Anti-Discrimination bill is directly addressing the issue of LGBT.
And this one is encompassing.
**Senator Hontiveros.** This one on Safe Streets and Public Spaces
seeks to provide protection especially to the majority number of sexual
harassment in public spaces victims who are women. Whereas, the Anti￾Discrimination bill seeks to protect from all kinds of discrimination and not
just SOGIE-based sexual harassment in public spaces but also kinds of
discrimination in different spheres of human and civic life for LGBTs, Mr.
President.
**Senator Sotto.** All right. I will not belabor at this point, Mr.
President. Let me move on to another clarification that we seek.
The charging or filing of a case against supposed perpetrators, we
have to go back to the issue of Senate Bill No. 1558, the Anti-Discrimination

bill which has a very laudable intention, I must admit, but, it may be
subject to abuse like what 1 brought up during the time that we were
debating about it. We cannot deny the fact that it can be used to get back
at someone or for revenge. Ang hirap patunayan on a personal adversary
kung... What are the safeguards that we have included in this measure in
order to avoid this possible abuse?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Mr. President, the Safe Streets and Public
Spaces bill seeks to provide protection to a large part of our population is an
understatement. At least half of all Filipinos are women.
It seeks to change behavior on the part of the woman since defining
sexual harassment in public spaces as wrong would allow women to
recognize their right to violence against women in public spaces, and it also
seeks to change behavior on the part of men by making them recognize that
street and public spaces harassment is wrong. I would like to point out at
this point, Mr. President, for example, that data in a survey in Quezon City
shows that men commit sexual harassment in public spaces, regardless of
their natural sex drive and educational attainment. There is a further study conducted by the SWS for the UN Women Safe Street Programme in Quezon
City which, as I mentioned at the start just introduced its safe street
ordinance, shows that three out of five men admit that they have done at
least one of the forms of sexual harassment at anytime in their life.
As in all cases of complaints, Mr. President, based on current laws,
the matter of proof must be satisfied by evidence, by due process and by
redress mechanisms provided by these laws. To make it even more precise,
under Criminal Law, the burden of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. And,
in relation to the Quezon City study I just cited, this study found a marked
behavior shift after the ordinance. So, it achieved its primary objective. And,
very importantly, to address the concern of the good Senate President, there
have been no revenge suits. Ang ibig pong sabihin, either the complaints
were found to be meritorious and, therefore, corrective action was instituted
towards the offender by way of giving justice to the victim or they were found
not meritorious. But none were not passed upon or not decided upon
because they were dismissed simply as revenge suits.
**Senator Sotto.** Well, I must agree with the sponsor. But the city that
she cited as an example is a very good city.
**Senator Hontiveros.** I will not object to that opinion of the good
Senate President. I am also a resident of that good city.
**Senator Sotto.** Mababait ang taga-Quezon City. [Laughter]
Nevertheless, again, so the lady senator cannot cite to me any
safeguard on the measures itself.

**Senator Hontiveros.** Well, Mr. President, the measure itself, as I just
mentioned, adopts the principle under criminal law that the burden of proof
should be beyond reasonable doubt. In addition, as I said earlier...
**Senator Sotto.** What part of the bill is that, Mr. President?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Well, it is not explicitly in the bill right now, Mr.
President. But since it seeks to be included in the body of criminal law of
our Republic, then it must and it does uphold this principle that the burden of proof must be beyond reasonable doubt also under the rules of criminal procedure. Also, this bill recognizes that the vast majority of sexual harassment in public spaces are women and the vast majority or
perpetrators are men.

Now, Mr. President, if men do not want to become victims of abuse or
revenge suits or in any other way to be disadvantaged, then they simply
need to decide not to harass women on the streets. In that SWS survey, two
out of every five men, a full 40%, admitted that they have not done even one of the forms of sexual harassment ever in their life. Gusto noting palakihin iyong percentage na iyon.

And, secondly, as I also mentioned earlier, the primary objective of city's legislation is to educate women and men of our rights and obligations and not to penalize men, Mr. President. **Senator Sotto.** All right. The bill provides for gender-based street and public spaces harassment which is a harassment made on a person because of their actual or perceived sex, gender expression or sexual orientation and
identity like SOGIE.
Now, am I correct in saying that a person may only be held liable
under this provision if the harassment was made by reason of a person's
SOGIE?
**Senator Hontiveros.** I tend, Mr. President, to use the term SOGIE
more specifically in relation to the Anti-Discrimination bill. But the good
President is correct in pointing out that this bill on Safe Streets and Public
Spaces seeks to identify and penalize and, in the veiy near future, hopefully,
prevent street and public spaces sexual harassment that is based on the
victim’s true or perceived sex or gender.
**Senator Sotto.** Then, are we not limiting the act of harassment when
it is committed on streets and public spaces by including the qualifier
gender-based?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Not at all, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** Baka pwede nang iwasan natin iyon. Kasi, for
instance, just to cite as an example. In an alley, a straight guy touched the

groin of another straight guy who just happened to pass by, just to vex him
or not because of the person's SOGIE, in this bill would the offender be held
liable?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Well, Mr. President, if the person, whether
woman or man, feels that she or he was violated because of his or her sex or
gender, then he or she may choose to seek redress of grievance under this
bill or under already existing laws, whether unjust vexation or some other
law that he and his lawyer may determine is more appropriate. But this bill
on Safe Streets and Public Spaces seeks to address a very real and quite
widespread phenomenon of sexual harassment primarily against women or
in the largest part, against women in public spaces including streets. Three
out of five women experiencing sexual harassment at least once in her
lifetime or 60%. That is a large percentage, which law should properly, and
in a good way, address also. There are existing laws which would exhibit
important gaps in women, especially those experiencing sexual harassment
on streets and in public spaces. For example, Anti-VAWC, unjust vexation,
acts of lasciviousness, Anti-Sexual Harassment Law. These are several and
important laws protecting primarily women, but there are still gaps within
them in terms of street sexual harassment.
Mr. President, we are addressing a specific problem—sexual
harassment in streets, and this is documented globally. Ninety-one percent
of respondents in the Stop Street Harassment global study said that sexual
harassment in streets is a major issue at hindi po tayo nabubukod diyan,
With 60% of women experiencing sexual harassment at least once in their
lifetime in this Quezon City study. Further, 58% of those harassments
happened on streets, major roads and eskinitas; 70% of these harassments
occurred in broad daylight, from six o’clock in the morning to six o’clock in
the evening. So kahit po sa liwanag ng araw, hindi pa dis-oras, hindi pa
kadiliman ay mayroon pa ring ganoong klaseng sexual harassment on the
streets.
Also, Mr. President, yes, persons with diverse SOGIE include
heterosexual men.
**Senator Sotto.** Mr. President, I need not be convinced with what the
intention of the bill is.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Thank you, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** I agree. But what I am pointing out is, it might be
abused. So I am looking for safeguards so that it would not be abused.
Like, for example, iyong sinabi ko, binibiro lamang, hinipuan na ganoon, will
they be liable? The sponsor said, “yes.” The answer, I think, is, “no.”
**Senator Hontiveros.** Mr. President, like all laws, any law may in the
hands of malicious people, be abused. We could say that of any of the laws
that we have passed so far or are passing through bill.

**Senator Sotto.** Yes, that is why we need safeguards.

**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President. But here, we presume that
if the Congress of the Republic so fit to pass all of these previous bills in our
Republic’s history into laws, and that now we continue to consider bills
addressing different concerns of our people, we are presuming regularity in
the final bills that we pass into laws. And further, we are presuming
regularity in the way that these laws will be implemented by the Executive
and by our law enforcement authorities.
So the possibility of abuse should not prevent us from seeking to pass
the best laws we can to provide protection to people. Let it not be said that
because of our, in a way, overestimated fear about a possible abuse of this
bill that we did not take the necessary steps to protect women from this
widespread phenomenon of sexual harassment on the streets.
lyon pong kunwari hinipuan lamang, even if that were to be the
argument or the defense of a heterosexual man—

**Senator Sotto.** No, no.

**Senator Hontiveros.** —I am referring to the earlier example, Mr.
President

**Senator Sotto.** Yes.

**Senator Hontiveros.** —against another heterosexual man sa isang
eskinita. Kung na-offend iyong isang heterosexual man, pwede po niyang
ireklamo iyan under acts of lasciviousness. Samantala ang babaeng
hinipuan ng lalaki, Hindi namin iyon tinatanaw na biro because that truly
makes women feel unsafe. And yes, Mr. President, may I confirm what the
good Senate President has pointed out, in fact, the persistent telling of
sexual jokes kahit sabihin noong nagbibiro na biro lamang, kahit nagsasabi
na iyong babae na Hindi siya kumportable, Hindi siya natatawa, o
sinasabihan niya iyong lalaki na, “please, tigilan mo iyan, ayoko iyan,” that
is, in fact, defined under the bill as a light violation.
It is in the definition of acts and there are penalties prescribed,
including for the first offense, a modest fine of PI,000 and/or community
service of eight hours inclusive of a gender sensitivity seminar to be
conducted by the Philippine National Police in coordination with the local
government unit and the Philippine Commission on Women. And the PNP,
has an important role in this bill because in the provinces, they will be anti￾sexual harassment officers or A-SHE. In Metro Manila, it will be the MMDA
officers. The MMDA and PNP will deputize their units to be A-SHE
enforcers. For light to medium violations, they may arrest immediately and
impose fines or community service and these A-SHE units, together with the
Women and Children’s Desks of PNP stations, will keep ledgers of violators. So, yes, Mr. President, iyong paulit-ulit na pagsasabi ng mga sexual jokes, kahit Hindi itinuturing o tinatanaw na biro ng mga biktima ay tinutukoy po na paglabag sa panukalang ito.

**Senator Sotto.** So, let me go back to the earlier answer given by the
distinguished lady.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** For me to completely understand what the lady
senator is saying that this bill seeks to fill in the gaps of the present laws.
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President.
**Senator Sotto.** But these examples that the lady senator cited
precisely have that law like acts of lasciviousness.
**Senator Hontiveros.**
that 1 am referring to.
Yes, Mr. President. May 1 point out the gaps
**Senator Sotto.** Nandoon naman, ano ba ang gaps? What are the
gaps?
**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President. I will be glad to share it
with our colleagues. For example, may 1 preface this answer by saying that
the rationale for the adoption of this Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill is
the absence of a law that defines violence against women and other gender￾based violence in public spaces. So, kahit po iyong tinatanong kanina ng
good Senate President about SOGlE-based violations but itong bill ngayon in
public spaces ang focus.
For example, Mr. President, speaking now of gaps, the Anti-Violence
Against Women and Children Act is applicable only within a dating and
sexual relationship. Samantala sa bill na ito, isang Hindi kilala sa kalsada
ang pwedeng mag-sexuaWy harass sa isang babae. The Anti-Sexual
Harassment Act...
**Senator Sotto.** Forgive me for butting in, but if the lady senator is
saying that, then why do we not just amend the Violence Against Women
Act and incorporate this?
**Senator Hontiveros.** We could do that, Mr. President, if that was the
only law with a gap...
**Senator Sotto.** Because it will not be subject to abuse like what we
think it might be. It is answering the gaps. For example, as the lady
senator said, there is redress by using other laws that are already existing.
**Senator Hontiveros.** We could do that, Mr. President, except that
just as we say or the view has been expressed that this bill could be abused or other laws could be abused. In extreme situations, someone could also say that the VAWC Act could be abused. But as I mentioned earlier, we are presuming regularity, we are presuming good faith in all the laws that we
have passed so far. Just for the sake of argument, we could simply amend
one law like the VAWC Act, except that there are several laws which 1
enumerated earlier which all have gaps in terms of addressing sexual
harassment against women precisely, in public spaces. So, to continue,
aside from the gap in the Anti-VAWC Act, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act
currently is applicable only within the workplace, schools or training
centers, not in public spaces, and can only be committed by a person
exercising authority, influence or moral ascendancy. Paano nga po iyong
sexual harassment between isang babae at isang stranger na lalaki na hindi
niya kilala on the street? Hindi pumapasok sa ganiyang konteksto. Rape
and sexual assault acts do not include non-physical, for example, verbal
sexual assault that degrades or objectifies women. So, hindi po kasama
riyan iyong mayroong dadaang babae sa isang kanto; mayroong mga taong
nakatayo roon, isang barkada, halimbawa, ng mga lalaki; tapos aalukin
siyang mag-sex kasama nilang lahat. That is not covered. Unjust vexation
for a fourth...

**Senator Sotto.** Hindi ba unjust vexation iyon?

**Senator Hontiveros.** Ito pa, Mr. President, fourth example, unjust
vexation does not require a sexual element and is blind to gender. So rito, iyong Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill sana ang tutugon kasi sa public spaces ito applicable at mayroong gender aspect. And finally, Mr. President, acts of lasciviousness. This law would require the touching of genitalia and does not make a distinction as to whether the crime was committed in a private space or a public space.
Samantala rito po sa Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill kahit hindi touching of genitalia—nto sa listahan ng light, medium and serious offenses—ma^
iba’t ibang klaseng sexual harassment and focused nga po sa public space.
Additionally, Mr. President, on the Violence Against Women and Their Children Act, we can not amend VAWC to fit the need of responding to sexual harassment on the streets because the nature of the VAWC Law precisely is intimate relationships in the context of dating or sexual relationship. And there, there is abuse of trust. Samantala po sa pagitan ng babae na naglalakad sa bangketa at sa strange na lalaki, wala namang
relationship of trust. In fact, ang pivede sanang i-cite at hingiin na relationship of trust would be between the woman and government, by providing that cities be safe and conducive environments for women to live, to study, to work, to have our families. Iyon po ang layunin ng Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill.

**Senator Sotto.** The sponsor mentioned that unjust vexation is blind
to gender.

**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President.

**Senator Sotto.** Hindi ba nga mas mabuting blind sa gender? So it is
available to all. Bakit gender-based lamang?

**Senator Hontiveros.** Well, Mr. President, for the simple reason, and
here 1 recall a wonderful moment during our interpolation of that other bill
noong mayroon po tayong colleague na nagtanong, “Ah, so ang ibig mong
sabihin, may SOGIE ako?” Because yes, every human, lalaki man o babae,
anuman ang gender natin, mayroong SOGIE. At dito sa Safe Streets and
Public Spaces bill...

**Senator Sotto.** Can the sponsor define again SOGIE for us to admit
that we have SOGIE? Ano nga ba iyong SOGIE?

**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President, gladly. Our sexual
orientation and gender identity and expression refers to the personal sense
of identity as characterized by, among others, manner of clothing,
inclination and behavior in relation to masculine or feminine conventions. A
person may have a male or female identity with the physiological
characteristics of the opposite sex. And, sexual orientation refers to the
direction of emotional sexual attraction or conduct. This could be towards
people of the same sex, homosexual orientation or towards people of both
sexes, bisexual orientation or towards people of the opposite sex,
heterosexual orientation. And the summary of all that in the definition, is
that every human being has a SOGIE. For example, 1 am a straight woman
and 1 am attracted to a straight man, that is also SOGIE. And it is
important that in looking at other bills, like this Safe Streets and Public
Spaces bill, we be not blind to, but aware of gender, kasi po nagkakaroon
iyan ng papel sa ganitong sexual harassment. Dahil karamihan nang naha￾harass ay babae at karamihan nang nangha-harass ay lalaki. And,
therefore, we address both groups of human beings and citizens in our
behaviour change objective.

**Senator Sotto.** Well, it just dawned on me now that we should not
start calling the sponsor’s bill, the SOGIE bill. It is just Anti-Discrimination
bill. Dapat kasi ay nagkakaroon ng ibang connotation ang SOGIE even
when I hear it from other people. Ang akala nila kapag sinabing SOGIE ay
LGBT. I think, we better start calling the sponsor’s Senate Bill No. 1558,
the Anti-Discrimination bill instead of the SOGIE bill. It becomes Expanded
Anti-Discrimination bill, parang sa ganoon mas mabuti.

**Senator Hontiveros.** Although, Mr. President, we are intepellating
the Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill.

**Senator Sotto.** The general term should be gender discrimination not
SOGIE

**Senator Hontiveros.** I venture to step outside this current
interpellation, Mr. President, to invite the good Senate President if he would
like to coauthor the Anti-Discrimination bill. In fact, it is in popular
language called the SOGIE Equality bill and I look forward to his
interpellation to that next week as he committed to me. But having said
that, it is important since our country is awake to matters of women and
gender, including SOGIE. And, our country has been taking steps forward
in anti-discrimination, that we bring those important lessons into our
consideration of a prospective law that we hope will protect women against
sexual harassment in public places since it is already a very noticeable
phenomenon, well-documented and exhibiting these kinds of statistics all
above the 50% or half mark—88% of these women are aged 18 to 24. So,
our young women—70% of the harassers are total strangers. So, there is no
abuse of trust possible there because there is no relationship to begin with.
Half of the women did not report the incident while 20% of them said they
were overcome with fear.
Ito pong mga numero, Mr. President, they have so many faces, lives,
names, primarily of women behind them na humihingi sa atin sa Kongreso
ng Republika ng proteksyon. And, that is what this Safe Streets and Public
Spaces bill is seeking to provide.

**Senator Sotto.** All right. Now, I will move on. Although, I must
admit that using gender-based in this particular point is...Well, I will try to
understand the point of the bill when it comes to that. Let me move on to
the issue of stalking.

**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President.

**Senator Sotto.** Why is the act of stalking under severe violations
when there is no direct contact being made by the offender to the offended
party considering that the other acts that the sponsor enumerated under
severe violations, basically involve touching? So, is it not stalking by
definition is being made stealthily?

**Senator Hontiveros.** Mr. President, yes, stalking may begin stealthily
or, in fact, it may begin in plain view of the victim or the intended victim.
And, in fact, stalking is a crime in many other countries and thereto has
very clear definitions.
Stalking is a severe violation because it is, in fact—to use a millennial
sounding term but very appropriate—one of the creepiest forms of sexual
harassment against women. It may not, at the start, or ever involve physical
contact or it may and it has the effect of, in a way, emotionally terrorizing
the victim, psychologically terrorizing the victim because imagine being
followed around the city which is supposed to be a safe place for her—where
she lives, where she works, where she studies, being followed around by a
complete stranger even if she is already asking him to cease and desist.

Furthermore, Mr. President, stalking is a violation of freedom of
movement from the US Supreme Court.

**Senator Sotto.** Rung fans? They stalk the celebrities, like Alden
Richards who has about a dozen stalkers.

**Senator Hontiveros.** The good Senate President knows better than
me. The effect of a stalker against a victim in sexual harassment is very,
very different from fans towards their favorite actors or singers or other
artists and cultural workers.
The effect of fans is to make the person who is the subject of this
fandom or fanhood—I do not know the right term—feel appreciated, to feel
supported and to feel loved. Stalking has a totally different and devastating
effect on a victim. As I mentioned earlier, it can really seriously cripple a
woman’s freedom of movement.
Further, Mr. President, speaking of the difference between fans and
stalkers, we have this story about the LAPD from Teen Vogue. The Los
Angeles Police Department having arrested a Milwaukee man for stalking
Miley Cyrus. So, even Miley Cyrus, one of the most popular and fanned
young actresses and singers in the world, also knows the difference between
a fan and a stalker.
Now, the same protection a Miley Cyrus has should be afforded to
Filipinas who are stalked in our country.

**Senator Sotto.** So, what was the penalty for the stalker of Miley
Cyrus?

**Senator Hontiveros.** In this case, Mr. President, the penalty was a
restraining order against the stalker of Miley Cyrus.

**Senator Sotto.** Bakit tayo severe violations? What did the sponsor
consider when she included stalking under severe violations in that case? I
am not saying that we should not include stalking. 1 said, we can. Bakit
under severe violations? Sa United States nga ay restraining order lamang.

**Senator Hontiveros.** Mr. President, the reason, as I cited earlier why
stalking is already considered a severe violation, is the effects it has on
victims here in the Philippines. The Milwaukee court found that Miley Cyrus’
human rights were violated.
In the bill, Mr. President, the penalties prescribed for the first offense
would be punishment by arresto manor, 11 days to 30 days, or a fine of
P4,000, provided that it includes attendance in a gender sensitivity seminar
to be conducted by the PNP in coordination with the local government unit
in the PCW.


I also note, Mr. President, that I have been mentioning the proposed
penalties including money amounts. And, in fact, if we are to get serious
about stopping harassment in the streets, then these are apt responses.
Other countries that have good anti-harassment laws such as Singapore, for
example, have far stiffer penalties.
Mr. President, stalking causes harassment, alarm and distress to the
victim. It may give precedents to more serious crimes such as rape.

**Senator Sotto.** Mr. President, the other offenses that the sponsor
mentioned here have the same effect. It is the same effect that the victim
has. Like, for example, making body gestures or exposing private parts for
sexual gratification. Nasa medium violations lamang ang mga ito—
harassing, threatening, intimidating. Mas malala pa ito, but it gives the
same effect on the victim like the effects that she mentioned about stalking.
So, why should stalking be under severe violations?

**Senator Hontiveros.** Yes, Mr. President. The light and medium
violations while classified as light and medium compared to severe violations
like stalking are still violations. But stalking has a different effect in that, it
is sustained. The light and medium violations, though they are violations,
may occur once. But stalking is sustained. And as I mentioned earlier, it
may give precedents, in fact, even more serious crimes such as rape.
Additionally, Mr. President, in the cases similar to what happened to
Miley Cyrus, stalking charges in California can be charged as a
misdemeanor or a felony depending on the circumstances of the crime and
the defendant’s prior criminal history. Misdemeanor penalties can include
up to a year in county jail. Dito sa atin ay 11 to 30 days. Ito, up to a year in
county jail and/or a $1,000 fine while felony penalties can include up to five
years in state prison and the maximum $1,000 fine.
Mukha pong kahit sa ibang jurisdictions itinuturing na severe violation
ang stalking at pinapatawan ng karampatang penalty. In fact, mas malupit
pa kaysa sa pine-prescribe. So, yes, Mr. President, stalking is long
surveillance over stretched period.

**Senator Sotto.** Stealthily.

**Senator Hontiveros.** So, this may be different from light and medium
violations.
**Senator Sotto.** Secretly, Mr. President. Hindi po ba? Kapag
nalaman, it is a different violation already.
Anyway, the Majority Leader is stalking me. [Laughter] So, I think.
Senator Villanueva is waiting for us. So, I will suspend my interpellation at
this point, Mr. President. I will continue next week.

**Senator Hontiveros.** Thank you, Mr. President.
I would just like to make a final note in relation to one of the
questions earlier asked by the good Senate President that gender-based
violence recognizes the power dynamics of straight men over women and
LGBTs.
And, additionally, Mr. President, in the same new tradition that the
good Senate President and I seemed to have started beginning with the HIV￾AIDS bill, I welcome amendments to further improve the bill, in particular,
the Safe Streets and Public Spaces bill. I welcome amendments on the
safeguards. And 1 look forward to the continuation and as the Senate
President told me yesterday, hopefully, the conclusion of the interpellation
next week so that I can accept his proposed amendments, especially on
safeguards and other amendments that he will make to improve the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President.

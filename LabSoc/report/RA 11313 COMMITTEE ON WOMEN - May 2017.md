COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, CHILDREN, FAMILY RELATIONS AND GENDER EQUALITY JOINT WITH THE COMMITTEES ON CIVIL SERVICE, GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION; LABOR, EMPLOYMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT; AND JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS HSGayapa II-1 December12,2016 9:42a.m. 1 MS. BALEDA. ..in the concluding observations to the Philippines’ combined seventh and eighth periodic reports which was transmitted to the Philippines in July this year to expedite the amendment of the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 and other legislative measures that protect and promote the rights of women. The proposed measures have also been identified to form part of the Philippine Commission on Women’s—Women’s Priority Legislative Agenda for the Seventeenth Congress. By the way, the WPLA, the set of topics proposed there resulted fromconsultationswithvariouswomen’sgroupsfromall overthe Philippines. So, we have specific comments though on the three bills. Madam Chair, may I read our specific comments specific to the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act? We would like also to recommend expanding the definition of sexual harassment to include sexual harassment committed in public spaces and public transport by any person. Some countries call it “street harassment.” In a survey conducted in two barangays in Quezon City results revealed that 88 percent of women have experienced sexual harassment in public places at least once and one in seven of the respondents experienced 


sexual harassment at least once every week in the past year during the survey conducted by Quezon City.<small class='sourced'> The Safer Cities Programme by UN women has also identified that stronger laws and policies against violence in public spa</small>ces as among the potential measures to protect women and girls from street or public place harassment. Another recommendation to the Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill is including a provision that will strengthen the monitoring mechanism to ensure that public and private offices create and really come up with an operational CODI or Committee on Decorum and Investigation. Madam Chair, even if the Civil Service Commission has already a policy for government agencies to create CODI, there are still some government agencies who do not have CODIs. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Director, I’m sorry to interrupt. I hope, Atty. Christian, you will comment on that point also later in your presentation. MS. BALEDA. Yes, thank you. More so with private institutions. Okay. A third recommendation to the bill is the prescription of penalties for non-compliance or violations of the provisions of the law because


as they saying, parang walang ngipin daw po iyong ating existing sexual harassment law. May I proceed, Madam Chair, with the comments on the other bills? THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Yes. MS. BALEDA. Related to gender-based electronic violence, yes, we recognize the aim of the bill to fill in the vacuum of legal remedies available with the nature of violence tends to disparage the personhood and the identity of the victims on account of his or her gender. We recommend though the following: First, we think that there is a need to really study the bill considering that the first two provisions identified in the bill are similar to those provided under Republic Act 9995 or the Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009. The first two provisions both cover the acts of capturing, reproducing, selling, distributing and publishing of photos and videos showing the private area of a person suchas naked or undergarment clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breasts without the consent of the persons involved under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy



The succeeding actions identified in numbers three, four and five under Section 3 of that bill such as harassing,hacking of personal accounts and unauthorized use of victim’s identity could also be addressed under Republic Act 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act. So, this would mean that in the case if this bill would be passed, threecasesmaybefiledagainsttheperpetratorforthesameact.So, in that respect, Madam Chair, I think we have to reconcile or maybe just enhance other provisions of the existing laws to consider the intent of the proposed bill. So, related to the legal remedies for LBTQs, although the proposed measure aims to address violence against LBTQs, at present, R.A. 9262 or the Anti-VAWC Law considers already lesbians or bisexual women who are victims of VAW in intimate relations. So, amending the Anti-VAWC Law to include electronic VAW as a form of violence wouldofferlegalremediesfor lesbians,at leastlesbiansandbisexual victims of electronic violence by their intimate partners. For other SOGI, maybe amendments to the cyber-related laws may be adoptedto strengthen and expand their coverageand consider the legal rights of LGBTQs.


And then there is a pending bill on anti-discrimination based on SOGI at the House of Representatives which could also— THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Also here in the Senate. MS. BALEDA. Also in the Senate. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Yes, Chief Baleda. MS. BALEDA. Yes, ma’am, which could be enhanced to already also include prohibition of acts that shame and insult LGBTQs in all forms and medium. This could also offer legal remedies to LBTQs for online violence which is the intent of SB 1251. So, we also propose, Madam Chair, to further take a look at because the anti-SOGI bill is I think more encompassing as it includes other provisionsmore than what is proposedon SB 1251. Wealsorealizedthatasphrasedintheproposedbill,straight men are not covered in the bill because it only says “women and other LBTQs.” So, straight men, however, are also possible victims of gender-based electronic violence. So, that is another comment, Madam Chair. For the Anti-Rape Law, we highly appreciate the proponents of the bill because they took into consideration the recommendations of


CEDAW such as emphasizing that absence of physical resistance does not mean that there is consent. | So, also on the increasing of the age of statutory rape, we have specified in our Women’s Priority Legislative Agenda to raise the age of statutory rape to under 16 but this is even higher. It’s below 18, the law. We just would like to propose another provision to consider issuing a rule on trial of rape cases which may include, first, the application of the rape shield rule as provided for in Section 6 of Republic Act 8505. And then the guiding principles on the appreciation of evidencein rape casesbecausethis was cited by CEDAWin the case of the rape of Karen Vertido. And then another one is the child and gender-sensitive decorum for lawyers, prosecutors,judges and other court personnel during trial of rape cases. Although there are existing initiatives by Supreme Court to sensitize prosecutors and judges, there is no provision under the law which really states that there is a mandatory training needed to sensitize lawyers, prosecutors, judges and other court personnel.


MS. BALEDA. ...would be difficult to operationalize is the protection order. How will we be able to limit or to monitor the e- protection order issued considering that it is shared online, even if the perpetrator has stopped sharing or has blocked—if the Facebook account, say, the Internet account of that perpetrator has been blocked, we cannot trace how many have shared in cases where the direct perpetrators no longer share them, a possibility would be those who are not the direct perpetrators sharing the same lewd photos, for example, which will further shame the victim. So, iyon lang, Madam Chair, iyong operationalization of the e-protection order. That’s all, Madam Chair. Thank you. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you very much also, Chief Anette. Actually, doon sa huling punto ninyo, an interesting point came out during our filing press con of this, what we call Tres Marias Bills. Dr. Sylvia Guy Estrada-Claudio mentioned that there are people who are doing a big research now here and abroad—Filipinos, but here and abroad trying to prove that once something is posted in the Internet, even if it is deleted, it is never lost. And somehow


possibly, even in investigations under these laws particularly the GBEV law if passed ay puwede pa ring i-recover as evidence. So, at least may active interest na ang iba’t-ibang advocates about this. And maybeouranti-cybercrimegroupresourcepersonmightalsowantto comment on that later. Thank you very much, Chief Anette. At this point, I just like to acknowledge the arrival all the way from Cebu, of Legal Alternatives for Women Center’s resource person, Irene Ann Caballes. Maayong buntag. Thank you for joining us. MS. CABALLES. Thank you very much, Senator. Maayong buntag also. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Salamat kaayo. Okay. So, now we will hear-—Sorry,Chief Anette, wala po kayong gustong idagdag na broad strokes, overview on_ situation on gender violence in the Philippines? As we go along in the hearing na lamang ba? Okay. All right. Thank you, ma’am


Okay. So, now let’s open discussions particularly on the anti- sexual harassment bill or Senate Bill 1250. May we call on the following resource speakers in this order: first, the Department of Justice and then the PNP Women and Children Protection Center, and then the Women’s Legal and Human Rights Bureau, then the Civil Service Commission, and then after CSC, the Center for Women Studies, the DOLE and last but not the least— nanditona ba iyongECOP?Kungwalapa man sila, but hopefully they can catch up. So, DOJ, will it be Asec Naga or Atty. Lorie? MR. NAGA. DOJ, ma’am. [Off-mike] THECHAIRPERSON(SEN.HONTIVEROS).I’msosorry. That’s right. Atty. Lorie Calo. You look happily familiar. MS. CALO. Good morning everyone. This is the initial position of the department and we suggest the composition of a technical working group to exhaust further the issues involved


In principle, the department interposes no objection to the bills which is but an exercise of the legislative power to make laws and introduce amendments thereto. We recognize the noble intention of the proposed legislation towards strengthening the anti-sexual harassment act instituting measures to prohibit gender-based electronicviolenceandmodernizingthecurrentlegislationagainstrape and sexual assault. Such initiative resonates well with the declared policy of the state to value the dignity of every person and guarantee full respect for human rights. However, we would like to manifest our observations and suggestions to SB 1250. As to the definition under Paragraph 3 of Section 3, it is quite similar to the crime of unjust vexation under the Revised Penal Code. Because unlike the acts provided under Paragraphs 1 and 2 where the act or conduct is sexual in nature, under Paragraph 3, it provides for a conduct that is unwelcome and pervasive. So maybe we can specify that such conduct is sexual in nature so that it is consistent with the subject of the proposed bill


We also observed that the word “training” is not anymore found in the proposed legislation unlike in the old law where training environment is included in the provisions. It may be observed that the Labor Code has a specific title on special workers which include apprentices and their nurse. So, maybe we can also include the word “training” so as to include the training environment in the proposed legislation. We also observed that the last paragraph of Section 3 of RA 7877 is not anymore found in the proposed legislation. We suggest that it be included so as to cover those who shall indirectly participate in the commission of the act. This would serve and strengthen the policy of the State to guarantee full respect for human rights. Also, since Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the proposed Section 3 enumerate the different effects on the offended party and the act to be punished must be of a sexual nature, the Committee may also consider consolidation of some of the provisions. That is our comments as to SB 1250


THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you very much, Atty. Lorie. At this point, I’d like to gladly acknowledge the presence of two colleagues,ofcourse,SenatorPingLacson. Good morning, sir. SEN. LACSON. Good morning. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). And my seatmate, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, good morning. SEN. GATCHALIAN. Good morning. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). And thank you, gentlemen, because with your presence, I am now able to declare the presence of a quorum. So, thank you. We are currently hearing, sirs, the discussion on the anti-sexual harassment bill or Senate Bill 1250. So after DOJ, let’s hear now from the PNP, Women and Children Protection Center from—Will it be Sir Carabbacan? Yes, from Police Senior Superintendent Carabbacan. You have the floor. MR. CARABBACAN. Good morning, Your Honors.



ThePNPwelcomeSenatorHontiveros’ Tres Marias Bill in the pursuance of the mandate of the State to protect persons. regardless of gender from all forms of violence and abuse. | We agree with the good Senator’s thrust to increase the protection accorded by law to women and the LGBTQ community against gender-based violence, particularly gender-based electronic violence and rape. That’s why the proposed bill which addresses sexual harassmentat the workplace,academeand trainingenvironment regardless of rank and station of the offender and the offended party is a welcome development to our current Anti-Sexual Harassment Law. On online landscape, our online landscapeis providinga new venue for violence against women and children. There is an emerging trend of violenceagainstwomenand_ childrencommittedonline. In filing cases against VAWC committed online, the PNP relies on RA 9262, our present anti-VAWC Law in relation to RA 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act. The proposed expansion of 9262 to


COMMITTEE ON WOMEN, CHILDREN, FAMILY RELATIONS AND GENDER EQUALITY JOINT WITH THE COMMITTEES ON CIVIL SERVICE, GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION; LABOR, EMPLOYMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT; AND JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS ADMasicap III-1 December 12, 2016 9:52 a.m. 8 include electronic VAWC is a welcome legislation to enhance the protection of the women and children. Our PNP legal services’ initial comment on the proposed bill which we will be sharing in the discussion, if you may allow me, ma’am. First, on Senate Bill No. 1250, an Act amending RA 7877, the officerecommendshoweverthatsexualharassmentcommittedby employees from other agencies and offices against personnel of other officesand agenciesshould likewisebe coveredby this bill.


MR. CARABBACAN. _...Secondly, ma’am, on Senate Bill 1251, an Act defining gender-based electronic violence, since the_ bill penalizes acts or omission involving the use of exploitation of ephemeral data or any form of information or communication technology, the same should be treated as proposed amendment to the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 which should also include the content data offense thereto. And then secondly on Senate Bill 1251, we wanted a more genericterm for LGBTQbecausefor now this is the only term that is being used widely. But I am sure in the future, because this will be forward looking, they might be including pansexual, intersex or anything in the future. So maybe a generic term for this thing will also incorporate all future terms within the community that will also be penalized under this Act, ma’am. Next. On the Anti-Rape Act of 1997, while the bill widens the coverage of statutory rape, this office has reservations specifically on the possible implication of RA 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, the passage of the bill may render this law inoperative as violations under this law may already be covered by the proposed law. This office



furtherrecommendsthat aggravatingcircumstancesbe specifically enumerated for purposes of imposing maximum penalties. That’s all, ma’am, and good morning. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you very much, Police Senior Superintendent Carabbacan. I noticed na na-i-present niyo na rin po iyong ilang comments niyo hindi lang sa Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill pero pati sa Anti- Gender-Based Electronic Violence at saka Anti-Rape Act. Kung nais po, either ninyo or ng ibang resource persons from the PNP including the cybercrime division or anti-cybercrime group balikan iyong mga bills na ito later on, makakatulong din po. And thank you for pointing out that in fact, as we become more aware about in a way the spectrum of genders and gender identities, maaaring madagdagan iyon. So tingnan na lang natin sa technical workinggroupprocesskungmag-a-adoptngabanangmasgeneric term as the PNP proposes or we just keep on adding the specific identity. So thank you very much, sir. Friends, let’s hear now, again, primarily on the anti-sexual— unless Senators Ping or Sherwin would—furtherrecommendsthat aggravatingcircumstancesbe specifically enumerated for purposes of imposing maximum penalties. That’s all, ma’am, and good morning. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you very much, Police Senior Superintendent Carabbacan. I noticed na na-i-present niyo na rin po iyong ilang comments niyo hindi lang sa Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill pero pati sa Anti- Gender-Based Electronic Violence at saka Anti-Rape Act.

Friends, let’s hear now, again, primarily on the anti-sexual— unless Senators Ping or Sherwin would—


O sige, later po. So let’s hear from the rest of our resource persons. Specifically or primarily on the Anti-Sexual Harassment Bill, from the Women’s Legal and Human Rights Bureau. Sino pong magsasalita? All right. Forgiveme. They are not here yet solet’s see if they can catch up later. From the CSC, so it would be from the office of legal affairs, Atty. Christian. MR. MOLINA. Good morning, Your Honors. Thecommission,in general,fully supportsthe proposed measures. However, for lack of material time to submit a concrete written position paper today, the commission respectfully requests to reserve the right to submit a position paper treating specificallythe provisions of the proposed measures within five days from today. With respect, Your Honor, to the observation raised that in certain institutions or agencies, there is no CODI duly instituted, the Commission does confirm that it really happens. Accordingly, the Commission fully supports any proposal to adopt measures to



strengthen or to ensure the creation of CODI or existence of CODI in all institutions. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Atty. Christian, sorry. What does CODI stands for again? What’s the complete meaningoftheacronym? MR. MOLINA. Committee on Decorum and Investigation. This is the committee tasked to conduct hearings on sexual harassment cases, Your Honor. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you very much. So the Committee will eagerly anticipate your position paper within five days as you said and then aasahan din po namin iyong pakikilahok ninyo sa technical working group natin. MR. MOLINA. Maasahan niyo po. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Okay. Maraming salamat po, Atty. Christian. So let’s go on now to our resource person from the Center for Women Studies, iyan, magsasalita po si Dr. Odine. MS. DE GUZMAN. Good morning. Thank you very much for this invitation


Firstofall,I wouldliketo laudtheproposed—orSB1250,you know, which is a high time amendment to the Anti-Sexual Act of 1995. This is important especially when it takes into account peer to peer, you know, like cases of sexual harassment as well as cases of sexual harassment involving subordinates to superiors because these things happen as we have experienced in the university and the law as it was crafted basically limited the ability of the law to precisely even discipline these individuals. So we support this proposed amendment. We have few comments, however, especially as the explanatory note is crafted. The last paragraph of the explanatory note asserts that sexual harassment as a form of gender-based violence diminishes women’s ability to thrive and enjoy their freedoms and liberties. We do recognize the importance of the explanatory note for contextualizing the proposed amendments as it introduces this and it is equally important for the purpose of setting the spirit and intent of the bill. So it is humbly suggested therefore to expand the proposed description to recognize that gender-based violence indeed may be committed against someone other than a woman because that section of the explanatory note limits the entire idea of gender-based violence


only to women. So it is important, I think, that this be expanded and eventually in the proposed amendments perhaps, provisions may also be added to recognize that sexual harassment is actually also committed, you know, like against other genders. The term for the offense actually is gender-based violence so that implies right away that the violence committed is gender-based which means that it may also be perpetuated against an LGBTQ person or even a man. In ourexperienceof handlingsexualharassmentcasesin the university especially in the last several years or so, complaints especially those cases involving peer to peer incidents have increasingly involved non-heterosexual students. To take this perspective and aspect of sexual harassment, they further provide critical nuancing to our understanding of this offense and make for more effective letter of the law consistent with the spirit of the law. Thank you



CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you, Dr. Odine. Let’s hear now from DOLE. So it will be Atty. Alvin. MR. CURADA. Thank you very much, Madam Chair


The Department of Labor and Employment welcomes and fully supports the good intention of the amendment to RA 787. We just want to inform, Madam Chair, that the Department of Labor is regularly, through its Labor Laws Compliant System, monitors the establishment of the Committee on Decorum and Investigation at workplaces as well as the coming up with a sexual harassment policies at the workplaces. In 2015alone,of the 44,524establishmentsthat we've covered, around 86.78 percent are compliant during visits. So at this time, maybe all establishments have been compliant because we require them to put up the policy as well as to establish the Committee on Decorum and Investigation. At the committee level or at the technical working group level, we want to espouse


MR. CURADA. ...we want to espouse the inclusion or clarification of the coverage of sexual harassment relative to the emerging employment and working conditions such as those in the subcontracting arrangements, under learnership or apprenticeship agreement.And we’ve also found violations relative to deploymentof on-the-job trainings at workplaces. We will still submit our official position paper within five days from today, Madam Chair. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you very much, Atty. Alvin. You may also want to take note of one proposal from the PNP earlier about looking at sexual harassment across offices or between two persons not in the same office. And thank you for mentioning also the importance of RTWG_ looking into harassment vis-a-viz contractualization kasi iyvon naman subject noong committee chaired by another colleague of ours, Senator Joel Villanueva, the proposed billsonsecurityof tenure,onbanningcontractualization. So thank you very much 



AndwalapapoiyongECOP,ano,mgakaibigan?Sokungwala pa po sila, for now we've done with our first round of inputs on the anti— Yes, sir. MR. LIBORO. [Off-mike] THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). I was going to call you for the next bill, if you don’t mind. And then you may wish to comment on all four bills rather than just the one. Okay. So thank you, Commissioner Raymund. Friends, we move now into our second round of inputs on the anti-gender-based electronic violence bill. So, we'll proceed with hearing Senate Bills 1251 and 180 which are respectively the Anti-Gender Based Electronic Violence Act of 2016 and the Anti-Electronic Violence Against Women or EVAW Act of 2016. So again, first, could we hear from the Department of Justice if you have comments on these two bills? MS. CALO. We have an initial position regarding SB 1251 but as to the invitation letter to the Department, there was no inclusion of Senate Bill 180 so we were not able to discuss that


The comments of the Department as to SB 1251 is quite similar to the comments of PCW earlier. The acts under Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 3 of the bill are prohibited acts under R.A. 9995 or the Anti- photo and Video Voyeurism Act of 2009 while Paragraphs 3 and4fall under Section 6 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act. While Paragraph 5 is also covered under the Cybercrime Prevention Act on Computer- related Identity Theft. So that would be the initial position of the Department. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Thank you, Atty. Lorie. Mukhang sa technical working group process natin, we will really have to look at the possibility of consolidating not just the two bills in this part of our hearing but also possibly these bills in relation to other existing laws or provisions of other laws by way of amendments. So thank you, Atty. Lorie. Let’s hear next-—-So yes, from the National Privacy Commission, Commissioner Raymund. MR. LIBORO. Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Lacson, Senator Gatchalian, magandang umaga po.


So, we’re from the National Privacy Commission, I’m with Deputy Commissioner Ivy Patdu. For our statement, well, we have before us the three bills currently pending before the Senate of the Philippines which relate to offenses committed primarily against the vulnerable sectors. These bills appear to be a response to the digital age recognizing that the benefits of the ICT likewise correspond to new. means for committing criminal acts. This is what we call “21°* century legislation in response to 21% century crimes against women.” And the National Privacy Commission welcomes all these_ initiatives. Again, as a body responding to 21° century concerns in crimes are the calls for the day. Thebillwhichdefinesgender-basedelectronicviolenceputsat the center the use of ICT as a means of causing mental, emotional or psychological distress to women and LGBTQ victims and defines the same as criminal act. These aspects as well as other notable amendments fall into the power of the legislative to define crimes and prescribe their penalties


The National Privacy Commission would like to focus on how these bills relate to the implementation of the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and the right to privacy in general. So, we'd like to bring your attention to three points. First, some of the acts defined as gender-based violence may also be criminal acts under the Data Privacy Act. Second,therearesomeprovisionsgoverningtheuseofrecords, photos or video as evidenced under the Gender-Based Electronic Violence Act that requires further clarification. We'll go into that in a while, Madam Senator. And third, on the right to privacy and protection of offended party is included in the amendments to the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act. They have not been included in the Gender-Based Electronic Violence Act. On the first points, some of the acts that have been defined as gender-based violence may also be criminal acts under the Data Privacy Act. In particular, Section 25 of the DPA providing for an authorized processing of personal and sensitive personal information. Section 31 of the DPA or the Data Privacy Act on malicious disclosure penalizing disclosure with malice or in bad faith, unwarranted or false


information relative to personal data. And Section 32 of the DPA, unauthorized disclosure of personal data. While we make this observation upon evaluation, we note that the provisions are not incompatible. Under the Gender-Based Violence Act,theactspenalizeundertheDPAwhencommittedagainstawoman orLGBTQundercircumstanceswhichtendto disparagethedignityand personhood of the victim on account of his or her gender will have a higher penalty. We put on record that the implementation of both will not be in conflict. On the second point, the Commission expresses concern on the legislative intent behind Sections 7 and 8 of the Gender-Based Electronic Violence Act providing for exemption and inadmissibility of evidence. We ask whether Section 7 is intended to allow law enforcement to apply to court for the collection of such evidence through means that would otherwise be illegal under present laws. I’m referring here to a pending law right now, actually, proposal from the good Senator Lacson amending the Anti-Wire Tapping Law. And this is under discussion now. So, may batas po tayo ngayon whichis still existing.


If this is the case, Section 8 then intended to mean that unless law enforcement gets court order for collection, any evidence collected would be inadmissible. For these two sections after they have been clarified we emphasize that it is important to put proper safeguards to prevent an unwarranted invasion of privacy especially if it seeks to legitimize acts, define these crimes in existing laws such as the Anti- Cybercrime, Anti-Wire Tapping and the Data Privacy Act. On the third point, we recommend that provisions that uphold the right to privacy of victims be included in all bills, doon po sa Tres Mariasbillsponatin.TheamendmentstotheAnti-SexualHarassment Act includesthe provision on the right to privacy and protection of the offended party. It says, “The right of the offended party to privacy in all stages of the investigation, prosecution and trial and protection from retaliatory acts by the offenders such as termination, denial of promotion, threats, unjustified negative evaluations or retaliatory suits against the offended party shall be ensured.” The Privacy Commission welcomes this provision. However, we wish to propose that the section be expanded. The general language might be insufficient to provide guidance on how the right to privacy can be protected. In many laws particularlylawslike the Anti-ViolenceAgainstWomenand Children


Act of 2004, Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and DiscriminationAct, that’s R.A. 7610, and the RapeVictim Assistance and Protection Act. Provisions protecting right to privacy is included usually specifying in no uncertain terms the mandate for maintaining confidentiality of proceedings or prohibiting disclosure of personal data without consent of offended party or court order. We derive from the language of these existing laws, our recommendation.


MR. LIBORO. ..our recommendation. Number one,_ in general, we agree that the right to privacy at any stage of the proceedings should be ensured. All hearings should be confidential and shall not be opened to the public unless ordered by the court or competent public authority. Any judicial, quasi-judicial, legislative or administrative hearing or _ investigation involving gender-based electronic violence shall uphold the principles of legitimate purpose, transparency and proportionality in the processing of sensitive personal information. Number two, we recommend including provisions that mandate the confidentialityof recordsand keepingprivatethe identityof victims ' or any other information where victims can be identifiable. These are records pertaining to the case that shall be kept strictly confidential and that no information relating thereto shall be disclosed except in connection with any court or official proceedings based on such report.. (b) The name of any information that tends to identify the offended party shall be kept confidential, unless offended party consents to its disclosure. (c) It shall be unlawful for any editor, publisher and reporter or columnist in case of printed materials; announcer or producer in case


of television-radio broadcasting; producer and director of film in case of movie industry to cause undue and sensationalized publicity of any case of violation of this Act, which result in the moral degradation and suffering of the offended party. Cases of this nature may not only open the offended party to retaliatory acts but because the case involves sensitive personal data, unwarranted disclosure may be humiliating and disruptive to personal relationships or cause undue harm to the offended party. So iyon po ang panawagan namin. Well, all government agencies involved in the investigation, prosecution and trial of the above offenses must protect personal data in its custody or under its contro! by making reasonable security arrangements against such risks as unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, collection, use or disposal in accordance with the provisions of the Data Privacy Act. So we wish to request the honorable legislators for support and initiatives for data protection and to continue to help us in building and embracing a culture of privacy in our country. This is what you mentioned earlier, Madam Senator, that the Internet holds no secret and kahit na po tumagal nang tumagal na ang mga records na iyan,


nandiyan lang po iyan at hindi mawawala at mabubura. Marami pong salamat. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Marami din pong salamat, Deputy Commissioner Raymund. Also for what could be really a major input to the bills, yung sinabi niyo pong posibleng pagsama ng right to privacy sa lahat ng mga panukalang batas. At ang ganda po noong paanyaya niyo sa lahat, for all of us to embrace a culture of privacy. Ngayon ko lang narinig iyan, culture of privacy. So one of the interesting things about these hearings, marami din po tayong natutunan, even beyond what’s already on the agenda for the hearing. So salamat po. Yes, please, Senator Sherwin. SEN. GATCHALIAN. I just have a very general question on privacy. I noticed especially during—I think when this bill was being formulated, I think the original source of this bill, I think, is during the anti-Marcos rally where a lot of the rallyists were abused electronically. But I also noticed that some of the abusers are also anonymous. They are not—I think they use fake emails or fake names. How do we deal


with this type of abusers? How do we deal with people who deliberately—I think may term yata ngayon iyan. Trolls, yata ang tawag doon. But they deliberately don’t register their names and they use their anonymity to attack and to violate women and children. How do we deal with that? I don’t know who can answerthis. I don’t know if our friends from the data privacy group can answer this but this is actually a problem. that is plaguing our—I think not only our country but the whole world in regard to anonymous identities. THE CHAIRPERSON (SEN. HONTIVEROS). Would the anti- cyber crime group of PNP like to address the question of Senator Sherwin? Also if there have been successful prosecution of such cases? MR. DE JESUS. Thank you, Madam Chair, Your Honors. Sir, yung mga instances na ganyan, we usually do social media exploitation. We can possibly trace, sir, yung source noon if we will do some link analysis. Wala, sir, automatic na pwedeng mag-pinpoint kung saan yung location or kung sino yung persons behind that so we do some analysis and link analysis, sir. We might probably identify those responsible.

HONTIVEROS). Senator Ping. SEN. LACSON. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Two issues, both on Article 266-A. One is on the proposal to increase the age of the victim of statutory rape from below 12 to below 18.

In fact, we are even lower than some African countries in this regard. But we would like to suggest to the good Senator to consider adding a Romeo and Juliet clause or a clause in age exemption, clause to the stipulation of statutory
